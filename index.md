## How to Contribute

Your contributions are welcome and appreciated! üôÇ

**Create an Issue**   
The easiest way to contribute is by asking and/or answering a velocity-info issue (5 points and a gold star ‚≠ê if you ask and answer your own question).

These are not product issues, but a way to contribute to user content, so topics are very open. For instance, you might request new content like a workbook, suggest supplementary info, or describe a hurdle and/or solution.

Issues are highly searchable, so make sure to search for a related issue before posting a new one. Also, because of this, you can use velocity-info issues as a sort of Q&A.

Just click on the "Issues" tab from the repository or the link here to get started: <https://github.com/UrbanCode/velocity-info/issues>
